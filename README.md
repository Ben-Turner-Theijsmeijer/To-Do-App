### Primary To Do Manager Usage

- **Add a Task:** Enter a task in the input field and click the "Add" button. All tasks must have a name.
- **Edit a Task:** Click the edit icon next to the task, make your changes, and save by clicking "Update." You may also click "Cancel" to discard all your changes.

### Other To Do Manager Capabilities

- **Upload Tasks:** Upload a CSV file to add tasks to your list

- **Recurring Tasks:** Whether daily, weekly, or monthly, a new task with the same information will be created for the next due date automatically when the existing one is marked as complete
- **Sort:** Sort by ascending or descending order of the selected option (Category, Priority, or Date)
- **Filter:** Filter the list to only display the selected options (Completion status, Category, Priority)
- **Search:** Find a task based on its name
<!-- (TODO: any other things search will check?) -->
